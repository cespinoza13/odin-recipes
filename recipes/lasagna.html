        <h3>Prep Work</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Combine</strong> the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out the ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3> Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Heat</strong> olive oil over medium heat and add <strong>diced</strong> onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add</strong> ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the mean to try and get it very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. 
                <strong>Add</strong> garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
            <li><strong>Add</strong> chicken broth and use a spatula to clean the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add</strong> the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, 
                then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
        </ol>

            <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to <strong>375 degrees</strong>.</li>
            <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once you get a rolling boil, cook the noodles to al dente according to the package instructions. Gently stir throughout the boiling 
                to prevent breaking and noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
            <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Spread</strong> 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9" x 13" casserole dish and add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Spread</strong> 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Top</strong> with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 1/2 cups meat sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish</strong> with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Top</strong> with 2 1/2 cups of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Spray</strong> foil with cooking spray and place it spray side down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Bake</strong> for 35 minutes. <em>Remove cover</em> and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
